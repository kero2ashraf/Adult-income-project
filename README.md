# Adult-income-project

here in this project i had used (pandas , numpy , matplotlib and seaborn) python packages 
my Questions is : 

1) Display Top 10 Rows of the dataset?
2) Check Last 10 Rows of the dataset?
3) Find shape of our dataset (number of rows and number of columns)?
4) Getting information about our dataset like total number of rows , total number of columns , datastypes of each column and memory requirement?
5) Fetch random samples from the dataset (50%)?
6) Check Null values in the dataset?
7) Perform data cleaning (Replace "?" with NaN)?
8) Drop all the missing values?
9) Check for duplicate data and drop them?
10) Get Overall Statistics About The Dataframe?
11) Drop The Columns education-num, capital-gain, and capital-loss?
12) What Is The Distribution of Age Column?
13) Find Total Number of Persons Having Age Between 17 To 48 (Inclusive) Using Between Method?
14) What is The Distribution of Workclass Column?
15) How Many Persons Having Bachelors and Masters Degree?
16) Bivariate Analysis?
17) Replace Salary Values With 0 and 1?
18) Which Workclass Getting The Highest Salary?
19) How Has Better Chance To Get Salary greater than 50K Male or Female?
20) Covert workclass Columns Datatype To Category Datatype?

my explaination :
The adult-income project is a machine learning project that uses the Adult Census Income dataset to predict whether a person makes over $50,000 per year. The dataset contains 14 attributes, including age, education, marital status, occupation, and race. The project uses a variety of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests. The project also includes a visualization of the data using matplotlib.

The project is a good example of how to use machine learning to solve a real-world problem. The dataset is relatively small, but it is still challenging to predict income accurately. The project also shows how to use a variety of machine learning algorithms and how to visualize the data.

Here are some of the key features of the project:

The project uses the Adult Census Income dataset, which is a widely used dataset for machine learning.
The project uses a variety of machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, decision trees, and random forests.
The project includes a visualization of the data using matplotlib.
The project is well-documented and easy to follow.
If you are interested in machine learning, the adult-income project is a good place to start. The project is relatively easy to understand and it provides a good overview of how machine learning can be used to solve real-world problems.
